Hi everyone! 

In this project we built a goal setter app using MERN stack.

1. We created a RESTful API from scratch with Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.
2. We secured our API by adding JWT authentication.
3. We created our frontend and added authentication using Redux Toolkit to manage our global state.
4. We added the goals functionality and added goals to our Redux state.

I referd to Traversy Media's tutorial to finish this project.

# mernapp_goalsetter
Hello guys!

In this project, we created a goal setter app using MERN stack. 

1. We created a RESTful API from scratch with Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.
2. We secured our API by adding JWT authentication.
3. We created our frontend and added authentication using Redux Toolkit to manage our global state.
4. We added the goals functionality and added goals to our Redux state.

I refered to Tarversy Media's Learn the MERN Stack tutorial for this project, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0exw-9YJBo&list=PLillGF-RfqbbQeVSccR9PGKHzPJSWqcsm&index=1.
Special thanks to Traversy Media!
